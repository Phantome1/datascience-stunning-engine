Spark is a fast cluster computing system.
It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs for data processing.
Spark runs programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk.
This is a sample corpus to test tokenization, stopwords removal, bigrams, and TF-IDF.
